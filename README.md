# SBMLT_Robotics
SBMLT working on robotics

## Purpose
This is git repository for Stony Brook Machine Learning Team's spcial group project. I will make this private repository if things are really get going and needs confidentiality. (As far as I know, they are participating [IGVC](http://www.igvc.org) which is actual competition with other schools. 

### Reading
We will share reading related to the machine learning techniques that can help the robotics team.

### Lectures

### Papers

### Others

## Data to expect

>As far as the data collection, I have yet to plan exactly when it will happen, but I have an outline of what we plan to do. Since the software team is currently waiting for the mechanical build to complete, we will assemble a mock-up of the robot (scooter with devices attached) and take it up to the soccer field with a few obstacles. We will then perform a few runs through pre-planned routes and collect the sensor data (gps, gyro, camera) necessary to continue with software development and testing. We will also be sure to record ground-truth readings along with our sensor readings to give us an idea of the variance in our measurement noise. I will keep you posted as soon as I figure out when we can make it happen.

This is the reply that I got from Anthony Musco (team learder of robotics software team).

He says he is mostly tied up with administrative works, so we have a great chance to specialize in analyzing data and giving feed back.

### GPS Data

### Gyro Data

### Camera Data (images & videos)

## Some possible keywords to start with
* Noise reduction
* GPS data
* Gyro data
